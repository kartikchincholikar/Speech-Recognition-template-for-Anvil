# Speech-Recognition-template-for-Anvil
A Google Colab notebook ( where we load a pretrained model ) which connects to the frontend ( Anvil ).

This enables us to load the latest pretrained model and quickly deploy it as a webapp using Anivil ( we sacrifice performance )

Front end code is [here](https://anvil.works/build#clone:KQR4L27JNHKZKUBL=SWANQO3SON2QPFMWZOWZBSMG)
